# PLC (Parking Lot Converter)

  PLC (Parking Lot Converter) is geometry-based rhino plug-in that allows user to run and generate structures and housing units above the any parking layouts. PLC transforms parking lots to habitable space by converting driveway to walkway, and parking spaces to affordable housing units. In the book “The art of building in ten books”, Leon Battista Alberti said that “If (as the philosophers maintain) the city is like some large house, and the house is in turn like some small city, cannot the various parts of the house -atria, xysti, dining rooms, porticoes, and so on - be considered miniature buildings?” According to Alberti, large open parking spaces can be considered as garage for a house. If we build housing units above the parking lots, it would not be different from we are building ADU above a garage. In other words, this project suggests ADU garage conversion in urban scale and PLC helps users to generate and visualize housing modules.
